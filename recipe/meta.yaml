  summary: Python extension for computing string edit distances and similarities.
  description: |
    A Python extension written in C for fast computation of: Levenshtein (edit)
    distance and edit sequence manipulation; string similarity; approximate median
    strings, and generally string averaging; string sequence and set similarity.
    Levenshtein has a some overlap with difflib (SequenceMatcher). It supports
    only strings, not arbitrary sequence types, but on the other hand it's much
    faster.
